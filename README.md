# Instanews Project 3

## Project:

The intention of the project is to create a one-page, responsive website that allows a user to filter top news story categories via the New York Times API.

The website is designed in three modes - mobile, tablet and desktop.

## Technologies Used:

HTML, CSS, jQuery, SASS, Gulp

## Personal Learnings:

SASS - Learned how to write CSS styling in SASS format, as well as create varibles and import other style sheets.

CSS - Learned how to create animations.
â€‹
jQuery -

- Learned how to pull data from an API, animate content (e.g. toggleSlide) and manipulate CSS classes (i.e. create, remove, hide).

- Understood the concept of loops

## Stretch Goals

- Custom select element plug in (Chosen).

- Display abstract text/article link on hover of the article image.

- Header smoothly shrinks and scrolls to the top of the page when a section is selected.

- Content is removed if the user selects "Sections"

- Changed the cursor when content is loading

- Added replacement text as a backup if there is no article abstract text from the API (title and then placeholder text)

## Installation Instructions:
